_Method_
Simulation, not real-world test results.
1000kg (1 Metric Ton) of force was applied to each 4'x8' plywood sheet.

_Results_
Top scale for stress under these conditions is apparently ~7.2MPa, probably below the failure point of most wood.
Top scale for displacement under these conditions is apparently ~1mm. Shelf sagging is became less significant, probably as the supports moved closer to the center.

_Conclusions_
Recommend <250kg per plywood sheet (3 metric tons total).

Structural timber would probably survive one metric ton (1000kg) per plywood sheet (12 metric tons total).

Reaching these limits may require extra screws, beyond those suggested by the predrilled holes in the CAD drawing.
